# Portfolio
In this website, I have my portfolio of both developer and photography experiences. I also take the user in a journey of my travels during the month. I will also eventually add history of travel as well.
| - There will be a css page per html page - |
12/26/22 (mm/dd/yy) I completed building and styling the Navigation bar across all sites and the footer. I also completed the home page.
The home page has media queries and it's using float left and more traditional styling
12/27/22 (mm/dd/yy) I completed the about me page, created a github account and push the repository as well as editting profile.
The about page is using grid for layout.

All dates will be in (mm/dd/yyyy) from now on

12/29/2022 - I decided to add another page to the website called "Life Routine" where I have a basically schedule, workout routine and eating routine.
I created this using HTML Tables. At the moment, the routines are not added in the website but once they are, I will update here as well.
