# Portfolio
In this website, I have my portfolio of both developer and photography experiences. I also take the user in a journey of my travels during the month. I will also eventually add history of travel as well.

12/26/22 (mm/dd/yy) I completed building and styling the Navigation bar across all sites and the footer. I also completed the home page.
The home page has media queries and it's using float left and more traditional styling
12/27/22 (mm/dd/yy) I completed the about me page, created a github account and push the repository as well as editting profile.
The about page is using grid for layout.
